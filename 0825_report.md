=============================================================
chat gpt suggestion for unsolved problems:

### 1. **Define the Problem Clearly**

Start with a clear and concise definition of the problem you're addressing.

_Example:_ "The primary challenge was to fully implement the TinyHAR model on FPGA using the FINN framework."

### 2. **Record the Process**

Document every step you took, every decision you made, and why:

-   **Initial Research**: What sources did you consult? What experts did you reach out to? Did you try and find similar work or solutions?
    
-   **Practical Attempts**: Detail every attempt to implement the TinyHAR model. What tools did you use? What were the configurations?
    
-   **Iteration and Adjustments**: Were there moments you had to backtrack or adjust your strategy? Describe these moments and your reasons for making changes.
    

### 3. **Document Time Used**

For each of the steps and attempts, record:

-   How long it took.
-   Delays or accelerations in the process, and reasons for them.

### 4. **Highlight Difficult Points**

Identify every challenge you encountered:

-   Technical limitations: Were there elements of the TinyHAR model or the FPGA that made the implementation difficult?
    
-   Framework limitations: Detail any limitations you discovered in the FINN framework.
    
-   Skill and Knowledge barriers: Were there moments you felt out of depth due to the complexity of the problem?
    

### 5. **Explain the Importance of Difficult Points**

For each challenge:

-   Describe why it was crucial to the project.
-   How did it impact your progress and the potential solutions?
-   If overcome, how was it accomplished? If not, why not?

### 6. **Present Evidence for the Unsolvability at BA Level**

Here you will build your case:

-   **Complexity**: Highlight elements of the problem that may require postgraduate-level knowledge or resources.
    
-   **Comparative Analysis**: If possible, compare with other BA projects or similar tasks. Highlight the unique challenges of your project.
    
-   **External Feedback**: If you consulted with experts or faculty, include their feedback or opinions regarding the complexity of the task.
    

### 7. **Reflect on Your Project Management Skills**

Even if the result is not "positive," this is your chance to shine:

-   **Planning and Strategy**: How did you plan the project? Did you stick to the plan or were adjustments needed?
    
-   **Risk Management**: How did you anticipate and manage potential issues or risks?
    
-   **Time Management**: Reflect on how efficiently you managed your time.
    
-   **Collaboration**: If you collaborated with others or sought help, how did you manage these interactions?
    

### 8. **Conclude by Emphasizing Process Over Outcome**

End by reiterating the value of the journey:

-   Highlight what you've learned.
-   Emphasize the skills you've gained in project management, problem-solving, and critical analysis.
